                                    <p>As the pilot program slowly came to an end, our team quickly realized a pivot was needed. The introduced service introduced needs for a new role, an in-house program evaluator, that existed in the program’s Services
                                        Providers. In addition, we also found that some Services Providers were better suited for verifying behavior change in their parenting programs and their Caseworkers (a stark difference from the locality’s Caseworker)
                                        contained existing responsibilities that alleviated some of the pain points initially discovered. Their business model, as well, allowed for more experimental technology to be introduced; beyond the confines a simple
                                        web or mobile-based application.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Too much emphasis was also given to solving the business problem from the Program Managers perspective, instead of the Caseworkers, as the solution should have been crafted explicitly towards their needs; particularly
                                        since the Caseworkers proved to be the most impacted by the technology’s introduction. Our team was, unfortunately, unable to secure enough time to conduct deep dives into Caseworker’s experience of verifying behavior
                                        change. My hypothesis is, had this been done, we would have discovered the need to pivot sooner from Caseworkers in Social Services Departments to Caseworker in Social Services Providers; particularly those with
