                <p class="text-blue">What’s the difference between symptoms and signs? </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">It’s important to distinguish symptoms from signs. Symptoms are subjective, meaning they are your sensations and experiences. Signs are objective features of the disease that can be detected not only by you but also by your doctor. Therefore,
                signs are more reliable than symptoms. Nevertheless, we still consider symptoms in making a diagnosis, and they are important because in the early stages of the disease you may experience only symptoms without any signs—signs may develop
                later.

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer"> According to various scientific sources, 10%–50% of males and 5%–30% of females who are infected with chlamydia develop symptoms, which means that most infected people don’t have any symptoms.
                <br>
                <br> In most cases, patients are not even aware that they are infected, and they can pass the infection to their sexual partners unintentionally.

                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Here we’ll talk about common chlamydia symptoms that most people get if they have any symptoms. Please keep in mind that most people never have any symptoms.
                <br><br>First, let’s understand how the infection is contracted, and then we’ll cover different organs and their symptoms.

                        How the infection is contracted
                    </h4>
                    <p class="mt-10">Chlamydia bacteria come into contact with the mucosa (inner lining) of an organ and begin the invasion process. Since multiple organs can be affected, we’ll mention symptoms for each of them.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-wrapper">
                    <h4 class="text-blue">Females </h4>
                    <p class="mt-10">In females, chlamydia first invades the cervix of the uterus and causes inflammation (cervicitis) followed by pain, vaginal itching, and painful periods. The urethra may also be involved in the inflammatory process, causing burning
                        and pain during urination and frequent, urgent urination. Symptoms appear 5–14 days after exposure. Early on, the symptoms are usually mild, but they progress over time. All these symptoms can occur together, or there can be variations
                        depending on which organ or organ part is affected.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Complications.</b>When untreated, in 10%–15% of cases the inflammatory process progresses and involves the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. This condition is called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The person might experience
                        pelvic or lower abdominal pain and malaise. </p>

                    <p class="mt-10">Rectal chlamydia manifests with inflammation of the anus and rectum (proctitis). The person might have anal pain, anal itch, rectal pain, and/or tenesmus (a sensation of incomplete emptying of the bowel). Symptoms vary depending on
                        the infective strain. Inflammation of the rectum can be associated with various chlamydia strains. Lymphogranuloma venerum (LGV) strains are rather common in HIV-positive heterosexual males.

                    <p class="mt-10">Statistics differ, but many sources indicate that 50% of males are asymptomatic. According to other sources, including the CDC, this number is as high as 90%. For instance, inflammation of the urethra (urethritis) may occur without
                        symptoms in 40%–96% of cases.2

                    <p class="mt-10">When we talk about symptomatic or asymptomatic rectal infection, we should first consider what chlamydial strain is involved. In males (predominantly HIV-positive gay and bisexual males) and women, chlamydia may present as lymphogranuloma
                        venerum (LGV), which can cause a variety of symptoms. Only 5% of people with the LGV form of chlamydia are asymptomatic (do not have symptoms). With chlamydial proctitis (inflammation of the rectum) caused by non-LGV strains, about
                        84% of infected people are asymptomatic.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>The most reliable symptoms are those a doctor trusts the most in establishing a diagnosis because they better explain the pathophysiology (how the disease evolves over time).
                    <br><br>
                    <b class="text-blue">Penile chlamydia.</b> The most reliable symptom is the sensation of pain and burning during urination. This discomfort is caused by inflammation in the urethra.
                    <br><br>
                    <b class="text-blue">Vaginal chlamydia.</b> Painful intercourse and bleeding after sex are the most reliable symptoms. These symptoms develop due to inflammation of the vagina. In the case of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), abdominal
                    and pelvic pain are considered reliable symptoms because they are quite common.
                    <br><br>
                    <b class="text-blue">Oral chlamydia.</b> Pain when swallowing food is connected with inflammation of the pharynx and is rather commonly seen in patients who are symptomatic, so it is a relatively reliable symptom.
                    <br><br>
                    <b class="text-blue">Rectal chlamydia.</b>Rectal pain, especially during defecation, and bleeding are connected with inflammation of the rectum and are the most reliable symptoms</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>The resolution of symptoms doesn’t mean that you’re fully recovered. If left untreated, chlamydia may remain dormant in affected organs for several months or even years. Sometimes the infection goes away without treatment, but we lack
                    precise data on how often and why that happens. In some studies, it was found that chlamydia clears more slowly in males than in females (2.84 and 1.35 years, respectively). Even when dormant, the infection can lead to complications,
                    so it is always a good idea to get tested. </p>

                <p class="text-blue">Could my symptoms be psychological? How can I tell psychological symptoms apart from symptoms caused by physical disease?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>We assume that your symptoms are psychological only if the disease is ruled out by testing. We always look for scientific evidence and facts. Since medicine is a science, symptoms follow patterns and rules and tend to be predictable and
                    logical.
                    <br><br> “Logical” means that symptoms follow a certain pattern. For instance, they should appear within a certain period of time (five days to three weeks after exposure, in the case of chlamydia). If you experience symptoms immediately
                    after sexual intercourse, we may question whether they are caused by an infection since there should be an incubation period before symptoms develop.
                    <br><br> “Predictable” means we should be able to predict what will elicit symptoms. Because chlamydia inflames certain parts of the body (the urethra, rectal mucosa, etc.), the pain should be caused by irritation (use) of that particular
                    area; for instance, by urination if the urethra is involved in the process. In this example, every time (or at least most times) that you urinate, you should experience discomfort. If you have pain during urination only at lunchtime,
                    that sounds quite uncommon and we would question it.
                    <br><br> We carefully consider your sexual history. There is a high chance of a psychological component if you have had a new partner (whom you do not trust), tried something new with an existing partner, or have health anxiety in
                    general. Things that you have never tried (or rarely tried) can be stressful for your brain. When stressed, people may start reading about the disease and looking for symptoms. It’s difficult to put all your symptoms into context when
                    you are stressed. The context, in this case, includes the following: When was the contact? Has enough time passed before symptoms appeared? Do symptoms present regularly? Do they have a logical progression? Are they predictable?
                    <br><br> Meanwhile, we never forget that diseases can have unusual and uncommon presentations, so we try to analyze all the symptoms systematically and in combination with the laboratory findings. Symptoms alone are not sufficient
                    for making a diagnosis. We can only make an assumption by putting symptoms into context. To distinguish between psychological and non-psychological causes, we suggest testing to exclude or establish probable infection. </p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">It’s important to distinguish symptoms from signs. Symptoms are subjective, meaning they are your sensations and experiences. Signs are objective features of the disease that can be detected not only by you but also by your doctor.
                            Therefore, signs are more reliable than symptoms. Nevertheless, we still consider symptoms in making a diagnosis, and they are important because in the early stages of the disease you may experience only symptoms without any
                            signs—signs may develop later.

                                    burning and pain during urination and frequent, urgent urination. Symptoms appear 5–14 days after exposure. Early on, the symptoms are usually mild, but they progress over time. All these symptoms can occur together,
                                    or there can be variations depending on which organ or organ part is affected.

                                (PID), abdominal and pelvic pain are considered reliable symptoms because they are quite common.

                            <p>The resolution of symptoms doesn’t mean that you’re fully recovered. If left untreated, chlamydia may remain dormant in affected organs for several months or even years. Sometimes the infection goes away without treatment,
                                but we lack precise data on how often and why that happens. In some studies, it was found that chlamydia clears more slowly in males than in females (2.84 and 1.35 years, respectively). Even when dormant, the infection
                                can lead to complications, so it is always a good idea to get tested. </p>

                            <p class="text-blue">Could my symptoms be psychological? How can I tell psychological symptoms apart from symptoms caused by physical disease?</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>We assume that your symptoms are psychological only if the disease is ruled out by testing. We always look for scientific evidence and facts. Since medicine is a science, symptoms follow patterns and rules and tend to be predictable
                                and logical.
                                <br><br> “Logical” means that symptoms follow a certain pattern. For instance, they should appear within a certain period of time (five days to three weeks after exposure, in the case of chlamydia). If you experience symptoms
                                immediately after sexual intercourse, we may question whether they are caused by an infection since there should be an incubation period before symptoms develop.
                                <br><br> “Predictable” means we should be able to predict what will elicit symptoms. Because chlamydia inflames certain parts of the body (the urethra, rectal mucosa, etc.), the pain should be caused by irritation (use)
                                of that particular area; for instance, by urination if the urethra is involved in the process. In this example, every time (or at least most times) that you urinate, you should experience discomfort. If you have pain during
                                urination only at lunchtime, that sounds quite uncommon and we would question it.
                                <br><br> We carefully consider your sexual history. There is a high chance of a psychological component if you have had a new partner (whom you do not trust), tried something new with an existing partner, or have health
                                anxiety in general. Things that you have never tried (or rarely tried) can be stressful for your brain. When stressed, people may start reading about the disease and looking for symptoms. It’s difficult to put all your
                                symptoms into context when you are stressed. The context, in this case, includes the following: When was the contact? Has enough time passed before symptoms appeared? Do symptoms present regularly? Do they have a logical
                                progression? Are they predictable?
                                <br><br> Meanwhile, we never forget that diseases can have unusual and uncommon presentations, so we try to analyze all the symptoms systematically and in combination with the laboratory findings. Symptoms alone are not
                                sufficient for making a diagnosis. We can only make an assumption by putting symptoms into context. To distinguish between psychological and non-psychological causes, we suggest testing to exclude or establish probable
                                infection. </p>
